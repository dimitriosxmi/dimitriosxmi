## Heyo! I'm Dimitrios :wave:
| Type of introduction | Introduction|

| Professional | I specialize in [Full Stack :books:](#full-stack-development), and Game development :video_game: |
| Personal | I'm a developer, but above all I'm human. That means I have passions that get me moving and enjoying the beauty in putting ingredients together to make something  new and tasty. Could be a meal, a dev project, even a new organization system. |

I am interested in all sorts of development in software *currently* I specialize in ðŸŽ®Game-, and ðŸ“šFull-Stack development.
### Here are some cool facts about me:
