I am interested in all sorts of development in software, it wouldn't be unlike me if I were to work in web development and than eventually take on a job as graphics programmer at some point.
### Here are some cool facts about me:
- The first non-web game I ever played is Wacraft III at the age of 4
- I value health above everything
- Toxic company cultures will be avoided or prevented at almost all costs
